                  To begin planning for Electric Vehicles (EVs), a community must know where the owners of EVs will live, work, and charge. According to the International Center for Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV charging in the U.S. currently occurs at the owner's home or workplace, and this trend is expected to continue as EV use increases. To learn more about EV charging infrastructure, feel free to visit the
                  <a href="/energyclimate/alternativefuelvehicles">Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's (DVRPC) Alternative Fuel Vehicles webpage.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to assist our planning partners, the DVRPC partnered with
                  <a href="https://ev.ucdavis.edu/" rel="external" target="_blank">Plug-In & Hybrid Electric Vehicle Research Center</a>
                  at the University of California, Davis, to provide detailed projections of where EV owners will live and how much demand there will be for workplace charging. UC Davis previously developed a suite of GIS tools to aid EV planning for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in California. Over the past several years, DVRPC has been working with
                  <a href="https://ev.ucdavis.edu/research" rel="external" target="_blank">UC Davis researchers</a>
                  to calibrate their
                  <a href="https://ev.ucdavis.edu/project/uc-davis-gis-ev-planning-toolbox-mpos" rel="external" target="_blank">Electric Vehicle Planning Toolkit</a>
                  to the Greater Philadelphia region. The Toolkit is run in ArcGIS and allows users to project where EV owners will live, work, and charge.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Toolkit produces predictions of the spatial distribution of Plug-In Electric Vehicles (PEVs) and the associated workplace charging demand of those vehicles at the census block group level. The calculations are based on the current (June 2021) distribution of PEVs from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJ MVC) via the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP); demographic data from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summaries; commuting data from
                  <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/" rel="external" target="_blank">Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), version 7</a>;
                  and commuting distances between block groups from DVRPC's Travel Demand Model. For more information on the Toolkit, please see a

                  The following series of maps show interactive results of the geographic distribution of PEVs and the associated demand for workplace charging calculated by the calibrated DVRPC/UC Davis EV Planning Toolkit for ArcGIS (the Toolkit). These results reflect the following PEV penetration scenarios:
                </p>

                <ul class="main-ul">
                  <li>
                    DVRPC Region: 5 percent of passenger vehicles (or about 200,000 vehicles) are PEVs;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Pennsylvania: 5 percent of passenger vehicles (or about 400,000 vehicles) are PEVs;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New Jersey: 330,000 passenger vehicles (about 10 percent) are PEVs.
                    <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562019/approved/20190603b.shtml" rel="external" target="_blank">This is in line with the New Jersey, state-wide, zero-emission vehicle adoption goal for 2025.</a>
                    However, this tool does not predict the total number of passenger vehicles  in 2025.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  DVRPC considered using projections based on planning horizon. However, there is a wide variation in the projections available, and there is no one "official" projection. In addition, these projections are generally at a much larger geography than the DVRPC region, Pennsylvania, or New Jersey. DVRPC consulted Pennsylvania and New Jersey officials working on EVs. Pennsylvania suggested that we use a 5 percent PEV penetration. New Jersey suggested that we use their 2025 goal of 330,000 PEVs. DVRPC chose to use 5 percent PEV penetration for the region, with no estimated date for when this will be reached.
