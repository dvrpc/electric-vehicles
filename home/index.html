                  To begin planning for Electric Vehicles (EVs), a community must know where the owners of EVs will live, work, and charge. According to the International Center for Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV charging in the U.S. currently occurs at the owner’s home or workplace, and this trend is expected to continue as EV use increases. To learn more about EV charging infrastructure, feel free to visit the
                  <a href="/energyclimate/alternativefuelvehicles">Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's (DVRPC) Alternative Fuel Vehicles webpage.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to assist our planning partners, the DVRPC partnered with
                  <a href="https://ev.ucdavis.edu/" rel="external" target="_blank">Plug-In & Hybrid Electric Vehicle Research Center</a>
                  at the University of California, Davis, to provide detailed projections of where EV owners will live and how much demand there will be for workplace charging. UC Davis previously developed a suite of GIS tools to aid EV planning for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in California. Over the past several years, DVRPC has been working with
                  <a href="https://ev.ucdavis.edu/research" rel="external" target="_blank">UC Davis researchers</a>
                  to calibrate their
                  <a href="https://ev.ucdavis.edu/project/uc-davis-gis-ev-planning-toolbox-mpos" rel="external" target="_blank">Electric Vehicle Planning Toolkit</a>
                  to the Greater Philadelphia region. The Toolkit is run in ArcGIS and allows users to project where EV owners will live, work, and charge.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Toolkit produces predictions of the spatial distribution of Plug-In Electric Vehicles (PEVs) and the associated workplace charging demand of those vehicles at the census block group level. The calculations are based on the current (June 2021) distribution of PEVs from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJ MVC) via the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP); demographic data from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summaries; commuting data from
                  Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), version 7 ; and commuting distances between block groups from DVRPC’s Travel Demand Model. For more information on the Toolkit, please see a
                  one-page summary of the Toolkit , the Toolkit instruction manuals ( Market Analysis Tool
                  and
                  Workplace Charging Analysis Tool ), or visit the
                  project site
                  on the UC Davis website.
