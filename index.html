        <p>
          To begin planning for Electric Vehicles (EVs), a community must know
          where the owners of EVs will live, work, and charge. According to the
          International Center for Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV
          charging in the U.S. currently occurs at the owner's home or
          workplace, and this trend is expected to continue as EV use increases.
          To learn more about EV charging infrastructure, feel free to visit the
          <a href="https://dvrpc.org/EnergyClimate/AlternativeFuelVehicles/">

        <p>
          In order to assist our planning partners, the Delaware Valley Regional
          Planning Commission (DVRPC) partnered with
          <a href="https://phev.ucdavis.edu/">
            Plug-In & Hybrid Electric Vehicle Research Center
          </a>
          at the University of California, Davis, to provide detailed
          projections of where EV owners will live and how much demand there
          will be for workplace charging. UC Davis previously developed a suite
          of GIS tools to aid EV planning for Metropolitan Planning
          Organizations (MPOs) in California. Over the past several years, DVRPC
          has been working with
          <a href="https://phev.ucdavis.edu/research/">UC Davis researchers</a>
          to calibrate their
          <a href="https://phev.ucdavis.edu/project/uc-davis-gis-ev-planning-toolbox-for-mpos/">
            Electric Vehicle Planning Toolkit
          </a>
          to the Greater Philadelphia region. The Toolkit is run in ArcGIS and
          allows users to project where EV owners will live, work, and charge.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Toolkit produces, at the census block group level, predictions of
          the spatial distribution of Plug-In Electric Vehicles (PEVs) and the
          associated workplace charging demand of those vehicles. The
          calculations are based on the current (June 2021) distribution of PEVs
          from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and the
          New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJ MVC) via the New Jersey
          Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP); demographic data from
          the 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summaries;
          commuting data from
          <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/">

          ; and commuting distances between block groups from DVRPC's Travel
          Demand Model. For more information on the Toolkit, please see a

              The following series of maps show interactive results of the
              geographic distribution of PEVs and the associated demand for
              workplace charging calculated by the calibrated DVRPC/UC Davis EV
              Planning Toolkit for ArcGIS (the Toolkit). These results reflect the
              following PEV penetration scenarios:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  DVRPC Region: 5 percent of passenger vehicles (or about 200,000
                  vehicles) are PEVs;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Pennsylvania: 5 percent of passenger vehicles (or about 400,000
                  vehicles) are PEVs;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  New Jersey: 330,000 passenger vehicles (about 10 percent) are
                  PEVs.
                  <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562019/approved/20190603b.shtml">This is in line with
                    the

                  However, this tool does not predict the total number of passenger

              DVRPC considered using projections based on planning horizon. However,
              there is a wide variation in the projections available, and there is
              no one "official" projection. In addition, these projections are
              generally at a much larger geography than the DVRPC region,
              Pennsylvania, or New Jersey. DVRPC consulted Pennsylvania and New
              Jersey officials working on EVs. Pennsylvania suggested that we use a
              5 percent PEV penetration. New Jersey suggested that we use their 2025
              goal of 330,000 PEVs. DVRPC chose to use 5 percent PEV penetration for
              the region.

              PEV Distribution shows layers for current and projected numbers of
              PEVs at the census block group and municipal levels. The municipal PEV
              counts were aggregated from the census block group counts, assigning
              the counts from each block group to the municipality housing that
              block groups centroid. The projected percentage of PEVs per
              municipality and block group are purely based on the penetration of
              PEVs and do not account for any increase in the total passenger
              vehicle fleet.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Current and projected numbers of PEVs are of great value in planning
              for the increasing adoption of PEVs. Electric Distribution Companies
              (EDCs) can use this information to inform where infrastructure
              upgrades may need to be made. Municipalities and counties can use this
              information to inform decisions on permitting processes that may help
              future PEV owners more easily install charging infrastructure in their
              homes. They may also see certain block groups that could benefit from
              PEV parking allowances or other mechanisms to ensure parking
              infrastructure for EV owners, such as requiring multi-family
              residences to include a certain number of PEV parking spaces with
              charging.

              Workplace Charging Demand shows layers depicting workplace charging
              demand in number of charging events and kWh of demand by census block
              group for the following three scenarios:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>workplace charging is free (free charging),</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  workplace charging is twice the cost of home charging (expensive
                  charging).
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              These two scenarios allow users to see how pricing the cost of
              charging can influence demand at the workplace. In general, the lower
              the cost of charging, the more demand for charging there will be. A
              business may only have enough capital or space to install a certain
              number of chargers. Looking at the scenarios can help the business
              determine how aggressively to price charging for its employees based
              on the expected demand for each price point.

              This level of analysis is useful for employers who may be looking at
              building a new parking garage or for new employers to an area. This
              analysis can also inform employers on how best to charge for the
              electricity that will be used by the vehicles. If an employer has
              already established some EV charging, this analysis could help them
              price it so that their infrastructure is not overburdened.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, this could help inform municipalities on how much EV
              parking they may want to require for businesses in future zoning code
              updates or Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) that are looking
              into infrastructure upgrades and need to know how much power will be
              drawn in an area.

        <h1>Glossary of Terms</h1>
        <p>
          <b>ACS:</b> American Community Survey. The ACS is an ongoing survey updated
          annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. It regularly gathers information
          previously contained only in the long form of the decennial census,
          such as ancestry, citizenship, educational attainment, income,
          language proficiency, migration, disability, employment, and housing
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p><b>AEV:</b> All-Electric Vehicle. An alternate term for BEV.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Census Block:</b> The smallest geographic area for which the Census Bureau
          collects and tabulates decennial census data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Census Block Group:</b> A combination of census blocks that is a
          subdivision of a census tract. The Block Group is the smallest
          geographic entity for which the decennial census tabulates and
          publishes the sample data (socioeconomic information).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Charging Event:</b> The act of plugging-in a PEV to charge the battery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>EDC:</b> Electric Distribution Company. The public utility that provides
          facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity to
          retail customers. Electric distribution companies are regulated by
          state utility commissions. Exceptions include building or facility
          owners or operators that manage their internal distribution system and
          supply electric power and electric services to occupants of the
          building or facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>EV:</b> A generic term for a vehicle that gets some or all of its power
          from an electric motor. Sometimes used to mean PEV, BEV, or AEV (and
          occasionally HEV).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>GIS:</b> Geographic Information System. A Geographic Information System is
          a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and
          present spatial or geographic data. GIS applications are tools that
          allow users to create interactive queries, analyze spatial
          information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these
          operations. Esri's ArcGIS is a popular GIS software application.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>HEV:</b> Hybrid Electric Vehicle. HEVs are vehicles that do not plug in,
          but have a large battery on board that is charged by the vehicle's
          braking. The energy stored by this battery assists the ICE in moving
          the car, significantly improving the gas mileage. Current examples
          include the Toyota Prius and Honda Accord Hybrid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>ICE:</b> Internal Combustion Engine. Gasoline and diesel cars and trucks
          use an internal combustion engine to convert fuel to the motion that
          moves the vehicle. Propane or compressed natural gas are used in some
          ICE vehicles as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>kWh:</b> Kilowatt-hour. A measure of electrical energy equivalent to a
          power consumption of 1,000 watts (about what a hand-held hair dryer
          uses) for 1 hour. It is the standard unit of measurement to describe
          PEV battery capacities and the amount of electricity transferred to
          the battery during charging.
        </p>
        <p><b>LEHD:</b> Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics.</p>
        <p>
          <b>LODES:</b> Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
          Origin-Destination Employment Statistics. LODES Data provides detailed
          spatial distributions of workers' employment and residential locations
          and the relation between the two at the Census Block level. LODES also
          provides characteristic detail on age, earnings, industry
          distributions, and local workforce indicators.
        </p>
        <p><b>MPO:</b> Metropolitan Planning Organization.</p>
        <p>Municipality: A city, township, or borough.</p>
        <p>
          <b>PHEV:</b> Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle. PHEVs use both an ICE and an
          electric motor with a battery that recharges by plugging into an
          external source. Depending on its exact configuration, the PHEV's
          battery can either assist the ICE, or fully power the vehicle until
          the battery has been discharged, at which time the vehicle continues
          to operate as an HEV. A current example is the Toyota Prius Prime.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>PEV:</b> Plug-in Electric Vehicle. An EV that plugs into an external
          source to charge an on-board battery that provides the electricity for
          the electric motor. Some EVs, such as trollies, subways, trains, and
          trolley buses, are powered by external electricity, from overhead
          wires or a track. Others are powered by fuel cells (FCEVs). These are
          not covered in this document, which addresses only PEVs.

            battery can either assist the ICE, or fully power the vehicle until
            the battery has been discharged, at which time the vehicle continues
            to operate as an HEV. A current example is the Toyota Prius Prime.

            <b>PEV:</b> Plug-in Electric Vehicle. An EV that plugs into an external
            source to charge an on-board battery that provides the electricity for
            the electric motor. Some EVs, such as trollies, subways, trains, and
            trolley buses, are powered by external electricity, from overhead
            wires or a track. Others are powered by fuel cells (FCEVs). These are
            not covered in this document, which addresses only PEVs.
